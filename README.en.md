# Jobsmith

**An open-source, multi-agent AI co-pilot for the Taiwan job market.**

Find jobs, audit your résumé, and generate tailored application packages — résumé, cover letter, interview prep, and company research. Generation runs **in the background** (it keeps going if you navigate away or refresh, and multiple jobs run in parallel); you watch the live multi-agent trace, then review and approve each package in your library.

Runs through your own **Claude Code / Codex CLI** subscription (no separate API key required) — or **bring your own key** for any OpenAI-compatible model.

> The app UI is in Traditional Chinese, tailored to Taiwan's job-search conventions (104 / Cake / Yourator / LinkedIn / web3.career / CryptoJobsList / DeJob / JobFrog). Data is stored locally by default; when you run AI features, your résumé and prompts are handled by the CLI or BYOK backend you choose. See [Privacy and Data Handling](docs/PRIVACY.md).

## Download

**[⬇ Download Jobsmith for Windows (64-bit)](https://github.com/kevin333353/jobsmith/releases/latest)** — a single `.exe`. No Python or Node.js required.

1. Grab `Jobsmith.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/kevin333353/jobsmith/releases/latest).
2. Double-click it. A native window opens (the first launch unpacks for ~10–30s).
3. In the **top-right control panel**, choose your AI engine:
   - **Local CLI** — a logged-in **Claude Code** (`claude`) or **Codex CLI** (`codex`) on your `PATH`, **or**
   - **BYOK** — `base_url` + `api_key` + `model` for any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (OpenAI, DeepSeek, Gemini, Groq, OpenRouter, Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM…).

> **Requirements:** Windows 10/11 (64-bit; WebView2 is built into Windows 11). Your history, settings, and `.env` are saved next to the `.exe`; Jobsmith does not operate a hosted backend, and AI requests go only to the backend you choose.

## Quick Start (from source)

> **Prerequisites:** Python 3.11+, Node.js 18+, and a logged-in **Claude Code** (`claude`) or **Codex CLI** (`codex`) on your `PATH` (or a BYOK key).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevin333353/jobsmith.git
cd jobsmith

setup.bat            # Windows  — one-time setup (venv + deps + frontend build)
# ./setup.sh         # macOS / Linux / Git Bash

desktop.bat          # launch as a native desktop window (recommended)
# run.bat            # or web mode → http://localhost:8000
```

| Mode             | Command                                                        | Notes                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Desktop app**  | `desktop.bat` (or `python desktop.py`)                        | Native window; first run shows a backend picker.                   |
| **Web**          | `run.bat` (or `python -m uvicorn app.server:app --port 8000`) | Open <http://localhost:8000>.                                     |
| **CLI (one JD)** | `python -m app.cli data/demo_jobs/ai_engineer.txt`           | Headless single-JD run.                                            |

To build your own `.exe`: `pip install pyinstaller && pyinstaller jobsmith.spec --noconfirm` → `dist/Jobsmith.exe`.

## Features

- **Auto job search** — paste or upload a résumé; the system derives keywords and searches 104 / Yourator / Cake / LinkedIn / web3.career / CryptoJobsList / DeJob / JobFrog **in parallel**, ranking by fit in **streaming batches** (results appear as they're scored). Pick your **region(s) before searching** (applied at-source on 104, result-side on the others), filter by **fit band** (high / mid-and-up / all), set pages per source, and track named companies in a separate section.
- **Search history** — every search is auto-saved; revisit it, regenerate a package, or delete it.
- **Résumé health check** — scores against Taiwan ATS conventions with concrete fixes and before/after rewrites.
- **Application-package workbench** — click *Generate* on any job and a multi-agent pipeline (parse JD → match score → company research → tailored résumé → cover letter → interview kit → critique) runs **in the background**: it keeps going if you navigate away or refresh the page, and several jobs run **in parallel**. The workbench is a clean, single-screen viewer — a live agent-orchestration trace on the left, the finished documents paginated on the right.
- **My packages (library)** — every generated package lands here with a status (in-progress → pending review → approved). **Review, approve, or delete** each, re-open one to the workbench, launch a mock interview from it, and export to **Word (.docx)** (PDF via the browser's print dialog).
- **Mock interview** — generates questions from the JD and your résumé, with per-answer feedback and scores. Start from any saved package or a pasted JD; **each job gets its own conversation tab**, so you can run several mock interviews side by side without overwriting.
- **Personalization** — remembers your most recent résumé (no re-upload) and preferences (target titles, tone, skills to emphasize) across sessions, and applies them to outputs.

## LLM Backends

Pick your AI engine from the **top-right control panel** — a **local CLI subscription** (no API key) or **BYOK** (any OpenAI-compatible endpoint). Selecting a backend takes effect immediately; the **Test** button is an optional connection check, never a gate. Local CLIs offer a **rescan** action and a **selectable model**.

| Backend      | Auth                                   | Notes                                                                                                    |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `claude_cli` | Claude Code subscription               | **Default.** No API key; strips `ANTHROPIC_*` env. Model selectable (auto-tiered by default).            |
| `codex_cli`  | Codex subscription                     | No API key. Model selectable; defaults to your Codex config.                                             |
| `openai`     | BYOK — any OpenAI-compatible endpoint  | `base_url` + `api_key` + `model`. Works with OpenAI, DeepSeek, Gemini, Groq, OpenRouter, Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM… |

CLI backends call the corresponding provider through the logged-in CLI on your machine. BYOK calls the OpenAI-compatible endpoint you configure. Jobsmith does not operate a hosted backend or send your data to the project maintainer's server. BYOK credentials are written only to your local `.env`. An API-key backend (`anthropic`) also exists for self-hosting or CI.

## Privacy and Data

Jobsmith stores profile memory, preferences, searches, generated packages, `.env`, and error logs locally. You can open **Settings → Clear personal data** to remove resume memory, searches, and generated package history; AI backend settings are kept so you do not need to re-enter API keys.

When you run AI features, your résumé, job descriptions, and prompts are sent to the AI backend you selected. Read [Privacy and Data Handling](docs/PRIVACY.md) before using the app with sensitive data.

```

- **Background generation:** each *Generate* spins up its own LangGraph `StateGraph` with a private in-memory checkpointer, run on a small thread pool — so jobs run **in parallel** and survive client disconnects (refresh / navigation). The browser **polls** `/api/run/events` for live progress; the finished package is written to the app database. This decouples the run from the HTTP request — closing the tab doesn't stop it.
- **Job search** streams results to the browser over **Server-Sent Events** as each source returns and each job is scored.
- An application-level SQLite database holds packages with a lifecycle status (in-progress → pending review → approved), user memory, and saved searches; you review and approve in **My packages**. _(The standalone CLI still uses a resumable, file-backed human-approval gate via `interrupt()` / `Command(resume=…)`.)_
- On the CLI backends, models are tiered automatically: **haiku** for extraction, **sonnet** for matching/generation, **opus** for the Critic/Supervisor (overridable per backend).

## Evaluation

Does the Supervisor reflection loop (Critic → revise un-passed documents → re-critique) actually improve output quality? A small golden set of 5 job/résumé pairs is run with reflection **off** (no revisions) and **on**, and the resulting Critic scores are compared:

<!-- EVAL:START -->
| Reflection | Critic pass rate | Mean quality score |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Off        | 60% (3/5)        | 85.6               |
| **On**     | **100% (5/5)**   | **87.5**           |

Reflection lifts the Critic pass rate by **+40pp** (60% → 100%) and mean quality by **+1.9** (85.6 → 87.5) across the 5 golden cases. Both "off" failures were cover letters making **unverified company claims** or an **unsupported experience claim** — exactly what the Critic → revise loop catches. _(One harness run; LLM calls are non-deterministic, so exact numbers vary run to run.)_
<!-- EVAL:END -->

```bash
python -m app.evals.harness     # runs the graph on each golden case, writes app/evals/results.json
```

The `summarize()` step is a pure function with its own unit tests, so the aggregation logic is verified independently of the (non-deterministic) LLM calls.
